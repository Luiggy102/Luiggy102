## About me

**I'm Luiggy** - I am a junior developer passionate about backend development, specializing in **.NET Core and Golang**, with experience in **SQL Server, Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, Docker, and Linux**. While my main focus is backend, Iâ€™m open to fullstack development when needed.  

I enjoy working with databases, optimizing performance, and creating scalable solutions. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, explore new technologies, and improve my skills. Open source and cloud technologies are areas that particularly interest me, and I actively follow industry trends to stay up to date.  

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
